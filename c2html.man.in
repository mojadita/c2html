.SH NAME
c2html \- A program to get HTML, cross referenced pages from a tags file
and C source code.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" The general command line
.BR c2html " [ "
.BI "\-2hdr \-b " base_dir
.RI " ] [ " "tagfile1 " "... ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B c2html
is an utility to generate cross referenced HTML pages from a collection of
C source files and the
.B tags
file generated by
.BR ctags (1)
command.
.br
The program constructs a database from the contents of the tags files
referenced in the command line, and then goes along, scanning all the source
files referenced in the database, and HTML formatting the sources,
interspreading
.B <A HREF>
and
.B <A NAME>
tags.
It also constructs an
.I index.html
file, or several, related files, depending on command options.

It uses 
.B @EX_PATH@
(see
.BR ex (1)
) to resolve the
.I tags
locations, and to edit and insert the
.B <A NAME...>
tags.

.SH OPTIONS
Several options can modify the behaviour of
.B c2html
.TP
.B \-d
This option activates verbose debug mode.  It makes
.B c2html
to list each file as it is processing it.  It also displays the number of
files processed, the total number of files to process, and a percentage of
the total job done as far.  Without this option, it only shows a rotating
bar, and a percentage indicator.
.TP
.BI \-r
This option makes
.B c2html
to generate path info in the
.B <A HREF>
tags as the relative paths between files.  This can be
usable when source files are distributed in several directories.  Without
this option, paths are generated exactly as they appear in the
.I tags
file.
.TP
.BI \-b base_dir
This option allows to specify a base directory for URL composition.
This causes
.B c2html
to generate <BASE> tags.  Useful if more than one directory
and no relative pathnames specified.  See
.B \-r
option below.
.TP
.B \-r
This option makes
.B c2html
to generate relative paths between the file being generated (the one where
the
.B <A HREF...>
tag is) and the file wher the tag points to.  When this option is not
present,
.B c2html
only outputs the file as it appears in the
.I tags
file, without any interpretation.
.TP
.B \-h
Help.  
.B c2html
outputs a help screen, showing version info and options usage.
.TP
.B \-2
Two level.  Generate Index in a two level structure, showing
directories at the upper level (the
.B index.html
page), and files and symbols at the lower (a file for each directory
scanned).
.SH FILES
If no file is specified in the command line,
.B c2html
will use the tags file generated by
.BR ctags (1)
